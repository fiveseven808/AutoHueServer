# Automatic Philips Hue Server


### Summary: 
Schedule your Philips Hue lights with Wifi-based Geofencing! Uses your phone's IP to determine if you're home! 

### Bonus:

>  * Whole House "Scene" Creator  
>  * Run according to a schedule or Toggle a light (or group of lights) with an Amazon Dash Button!  


**Instructions as of 6/23/16**  
**Requirements:**

  * Install [WinHue 3 BETA 15](https://github.com/Hyrules/WinHue3) or greater
  * Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/) (to run or compile the AHK files)
	
**Instructions:**

  1. Double click "Hue Wifi Home Scan v1.9_scheduler.ahk" to understand syntax
  2. Modify Wifi\_Return_sch.ahk to suit your needs (get light numbers and light specs with WinHue's WHC.exe)
		

**First upload**
6/23/16

	First upload to github. 
	Files are all shitty and the directory structure is all fucked up. 
	But files are online and I can start changing and rearranging them. 
	I might have to rewrite eveything.... probably gotta clean things up...
	Goals for the upcoming build:
		 
		 
		 
**Wishlist:**

  * Proper animation handling (and creation?!, depends if WinHue will beat me to it) 
  * Proper GUI based scheduling (instead of modifying an AHK)
