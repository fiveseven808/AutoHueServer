First up

	First upload to github. 
	Files are all shitty and the directory structure is all fucked up. 
	But files are online and I can start changing and rearranging them. 
	I might have to rewrite eveything.... probably gotta clean things up...
	Goals for the upcoming build:
		 
		 
		 
Wishlist:

  * Proper animation handling (and creation?!, depends if WinHue will beat me to it) 
  * Proper GUI based scheduling (instead of modifying an AHK)
