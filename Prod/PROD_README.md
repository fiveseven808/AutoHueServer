	My first attempt at a Production version.  
	No fancy scheduling since I can't figure out how to do it without AHK.  
	Just turns lights on and off based on your phones presence. 
		 
		 
		 
**Wishlist:**

  * Proper animation handling (and creation?!, depends if WinHue will beat me to it) 
  * Proper GUI based scheduling (instead of modifying an AHK)
  * The ability to save and replay whole house scenes without relying on AHK... maybe make batch files from computer specific attributes. i.e. scenes only work per house which would make sense.
