Whole House Scene Creator 
=============
## Whole House Scene Creator 


### Summary: Updated 7/5/2016
Schedule your Philips Hue lights with Wifi-based Geofencing! Uses your phone's IP to determine if you're home!  

###### No Lazy method for this one. Just run one of the two scene creator AHKs to make a group or individual light based whole house "scene"

**Instructions as of 7/5/16**  
**Requirements:**

  * Install [WinHue 3 BETA ](https://github.com/Hyrules/WinHue3) or greater
  * Requires WinHue 3 BETA 16 or greater for the group script to work properly
  * Install [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/) (to run or compile the AHK files)
	
**Instructions: (vague since I'm lazy)**

  1. Edit the number of lights or groups in each AHK
  2. Set all of the lights in your house to the particular scene you would like (i.e. bathroom dim, porch light on, everything else bright)
  3. Execute the group or individual light AHK and wait till finished
  4. Name the scene however you like
		
		  	 
**Wishlist:**

  * GUI to detect (and save) the number of lights and groups you have in your house 
  * GUI will also allow a transition time i.e. 30 minutes, or 10 seconds, etc. 
  * GUI will display and list and allow you to modify (and test) the attributes of each light and or group depending on mode
