notes. persistance
i like my lights to do things like stay at their set schedule or follow it. that means that if a light is extra bright when i actually want it dim, let's give it a way to go back to being dim without having to follow a set shedule

i.e. bedroom lights are at 50%. but i go in and make 100% becuase i needed to look for something. 
if it was on a set schedule, i would have to wait for that schedule
but if i had a daemon that monitored that light and kept PERSISTANCE then i would say, check every 





how to sync up all programs? 
c:\killall.ctl

make a subroutine that loooks for certain files in certain directories. easiest is base C drive. can make a C:\huebits\control

control standard:
num = arbitrary number that is assigned when running the program, either in gui or command line
stop%num%.ctl
stop_animation%num%.ctl
animation%num%.ctl ;this one shows if a particular animation is currently running


-----------------
need to have a control program. 
delete all of the ctl files
and use the conrol program as a lancher to start all of the smaller programs
that way we can doublecheck to make sure that animationand such files are deleted when their program closes
the control prgoram can set and control the subprocesses
